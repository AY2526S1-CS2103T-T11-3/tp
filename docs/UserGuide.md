# EASync User Guide

EASync is a desktop app designed to help student club managers stay organized with ease. Whether you are coordinating events, tracking member roles, or updating contact lists, EASync makes it easy to manage everything from one club book.

You do not need to be a programmer or technical expert. Using EASync is like sending a text: simple, fast, and intuitive. It‚Äôs designed to be visual and beginner-friendly, so you can focus on running your club, not figuring out complicated software or clicking through menus.

## Quick start

1. **Set up Java** <br>
To run EASync, your computer needs to have Java version 17 or higher installed. Using the step-by-step guides [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallation.html), you can:
    * Check if Java is already installed on your computer. 
    * Install the correct version if needed. 
    * Verify your installation afterward.

2. **Download EASync** <br>
   Go to [our releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/releases) to download the latest `EASync.jar` file.

3. **Choose a Folder for EASync** <br>
   * Create or pick a folder where you would like to keep your EASync files. 
   * Then, move the `EASync.jar` file you just downloaded into that folder. <br>
   üìÅ Example: You could create a folder on your Desktop called `EASync`.

4. **Run EASync** <br>
   Open a command terminal, navigate into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar EASync.jar` command to run the application. 
   * You can navigate between folders using the `cd path/to/your/folder` command in the terminal. For example, `cd C:/Users/<your username>/Desktop/EASync`.
   * After a few seconds, EASync will open, and you should see a window like this:<br>

   For example: Type `help` and press *Enter* ‚Äî this opens the Help window.<br>

   üí° Commands for getting started:

   * `listEvents` : Shows all the events currently in your club book.

   * `addMember n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com` : Adds a member named `John Doe` to the club book. <br> Notice that EASync switches to display the member list.

   * `addEvent n/Team Bonding f/151025 1300 t/161025 1500` : Adds an event named `Team Bonding` to the club book. <br> Notice that EASync switches to display the event list.

   * `assignEvent e/Team Bonding m/John Doe r/Logistics` : Assigns `John Doe` to handle `Logistics` in the `Team Bonding` event. <br> Notice that EASync switches to display the details of the single event Team Bonding.

   * `exit` : Closes the window and exits the program.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info">

**Notes about the command format:** <br>

* **Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters that you type in.**<br>
  e.g. in `addMember n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addMember n/John Doe`.

* **Items in square brackets are optional**. <br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [r/MEMBERROLE]` can be used as `n/John Doe r/Logistics` or as `n/John Doe`.

* **Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times, or omitted completely.**<br>
  e.g. `[r/MEMBERROLE]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be `r/Logistics`, `t/Publicity t/Logistics` or not be used at all.

* **For `NAME` and `MEMBERROLE` and `DETAILS` parameters, multiple spaces will be treated as single space.**<br>
  e.g. `n/John     Doe` will be treated as `n/John Doe`.
</box>

<box type="tip">

**Tips for command flexibility:** <br>

* **Parameters can be in any order.**<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* **Any extra parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.**<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
</box>

<box type="warning">

**Handling duplicates:** <br>

* All names (such as member names, event names, and event role names etc.) are considered duplicates if they have the **same spelling and spacing, ignoring letter case.**<br>
  e.g. `John Doe` and `john doe` are the same, but `John Doe` and `JohnDoe` are different.
</box>

</box>

<box type="tip">

**Tip:**
If you would like to get the sample data to show again, you could remove the `clubBook.json` file from the `data` folder that is in the folder `EASync.jar` is in. Do note the warning above still applies!
</box>

#### Exiting the program: `exit`

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

EASync saves new data to the hard disk automatically, after any command is run. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Easync data is saved automatically as a JSON file in `[JAR file location]/data/clubBook.json`.

**Advanced users** are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="important">

**Caution:**
**If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, EASync will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.** Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause EASync to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ
**Q**: I deleted a member/event by mistake, can I undo it? <br>
**A**: There‚Äôs no undo feature yet, and changes save immediately. If you have a backup of members.json or events.json, restore it to recover. Otherwise, re-add the item manually. It is planned for a future release however, and this guide will be updated when it‚Äôs available.

**Q**: Can I delete several members/events at once? <br>
**A**: There‚Äôs no bulk delete feature yet. You can remove multiple items by running deleteMember or deleteEvent repeatedly. It is planned for a future release however, and this guide will be updated when it‚Äôs available.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Follow these steps:
  1. Make a copy of the `data` folder in the **home folder of your current installation**.
  2. Install EASync on another computer (follow the [Quick Start guide](#quick-start))
  3. Take the copied `data` folder and overwrite the `data` folder in the **home folder of your new installation**
  4. Run EASync on the new computer and verify that your data has been transferred successfully.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
